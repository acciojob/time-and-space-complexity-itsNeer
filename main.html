	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of the input data. efficient algorithms are those that have lower time complexity, meaning they perform better and faster as the input size grows.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of the input data. <b>Space Complexity</b> is often expressed using big O notation, such as O(n), to describe how the memory requirements grow with the input size.</p>
